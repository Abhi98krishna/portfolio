					<div class="body-text">Working as a cabin crew member implies expending a lot of energy and following strict protocols. Over the course of a flight trip, they have to maintain efficiency in long hours of service on flights, adjust to ever-changing time-zones, and repeat this, sometimes, with very little time between journeys. <span class="bold-text">Cabin crew members</span>, being working tourists, <span class="bold-text">have long been ignored in the development of their work environment</span>, something that has not changed in a long time. In order to aid them in their jobs, we have envisioned a smartwatch based technology that each member uses throughout the flight.</div>
